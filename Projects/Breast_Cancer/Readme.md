# The Problem:
## Cancer can be either benign or malignant. We are set to classify the cancer based on the set of 30 features:

  - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
  - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  - perimeter
  - area
  - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
  - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
  - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
  - symmetry 
  - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Number of Samples: 569; 212 of which are Malignant and 357 Benign
